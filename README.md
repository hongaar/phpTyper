About
-----

Created by [Nabble](http://nabble.nl) because the [interactive PHP shell](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.interactive.php) wasn't HTML5 enough for us.

Front-end created using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) and [hash.js](http://jonnystromberg.com/hash-js). The execution environment uses parts of [PHPSandbox](https://github.com/fregster/PHPSandbox)

Install
-------

 - Download the [PHP documentation](http://www.php.net/download-docs.php) to the `doc/php-chunked-xhtml` directory.
 - The `tmp` and `code` directories should be writable, but restrict access to the `.htaccess` file in both these directories.
 - Make sure you understand what you are doing. Generally, giving untrusted users access to your execution environment is not a good idea.
